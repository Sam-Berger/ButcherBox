Things I learned with this project:

The basics of creating a Chrome Extension
How to get Firebase Database to connect with a Chrome Extension
Using an API (Chrome API, Firebase API)
How "complex" websites are structured since I spend so much time in the ButcherBox source code
How to manipulate the DOM more effectively
Its not helpful to define new functions within other functions, It is better to always just declare them indepently and then call them. Caused unnecessary refactoring
