Things I learned with this project:

The basics of creating a Chrome Extension
Using an API
How "complex" websites are structured since I spend so much time in the ButcherBox source code
How to manipulate the DOM more effectively
Its not helpful to define new functions within other functions, It is better to always just declare them indepently and then call them. Caused unnecessary refactoring
